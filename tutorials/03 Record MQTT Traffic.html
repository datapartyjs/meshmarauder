    <title>Tutorial - Record MQTT traffic</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>You can record Defcon MQTT traffic by running <tt>bin/mqtt-record</tt>
        You'll need to have <tt>mqtt-recorder</tt> installed for this script
        to work, which can be installed via PyPI. This will be left as an
        exercise for the reader. Once the required dependencies are met the
        output of this script can be saved to a file, or piped into something
        else.</p>

    <p>One of the things that the output of this script can be piped into is 
        the <tt>bin/mqtt-convert</tt>. This script is intended to convert the
        MQTT packets into the same raw format emitted by <tt>lorapipe</tt>. As 
        with many of the other tools in this repository, <tt>mqtt-convert</tt>
        can be saved to a file, or piped into something else!</p>
