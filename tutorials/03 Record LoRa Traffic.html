    <title>Tutorial - Record LoRa traffic</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Once you have lorapipe flashed on your hardware, it's time to start
        capturing traffic. You will need to fetch
        <a href="https://github.com/datapartyjs/meshmarauder">MeshMarauder</a>,
        find the serial port that your lorapipe node is running on, and then
        run the <tt>lora-scanner</tt> tool in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory of
        the repository. You can  run the following commands to do so: </p>

    <pre>
    $ git clone https://github.com/datapartyjs/meshmarauder
    $ cd meshmarauder
    $ dmesg    # run this after plugging in your lorapipe node, and the
               # /dev/tty device that appears is what you'll use
    $ bin/lora-scanner -D &lt;tty&gt; -p 917.25,500.0,7,8,2b
    </pre>

    <p>This will dump raw packets heard on the Defcon Meshtastic modem preset.
        You can record this to a file, or pipe it into something else.</p>
