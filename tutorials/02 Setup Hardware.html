    <title>Tutorial - Setup meshmarauder hardware</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>To get set up, you're going to need LoRA node hardware. Anything on the
        list of the <a href="https://flasher.meshcore.dev/">Meshcore
        flasher</a> will work, as lorapipe is based on a very stripped down
        copy of Meshcore.</pp>
        
    <p>Git clone
        <a href="https://github.com/datapartyjs/lorapipe/">lorapipe</a>,
        and install PlatformIO, for example, on Ubuntu: </p>

    <pre>
    $ sudo apt install git platformio
    $ git clone https://github.com/datapartyjs/lorapipe/
    </pre>
    
    <p>Build and flash the firmware using PlatformIO: </p>

    <pre>
    $ cd lorapipe
    $ platformio run --environment Xiao_S3_WIO_Repeater
    $ platformio run --target upload --environment Xiao_S3_WIO_Repeater
    </pre>

    <p>Visual Studio Code's PlatformIO extension is extremely convenient, and
        will handle much of this for you!</p>

    <p>Once you have your hardware flashed with lorapipe, you're ready to start
        recording and sending LoRA traffic. lorapipe gives users an interface
        to send and recieve raw bytes encoded using almost any LoRA modem
        preset (frequency, bandwidth, spread factor, coding rate, and sync
        word). This gives users the ability to send and recieve raw data over
        LoRA in a manner that is entirely agnostic of any overlying packet
        format.</p>
