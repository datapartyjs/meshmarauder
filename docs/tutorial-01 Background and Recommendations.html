Recommendations</h2></header><article><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><title>Tutorial - Exploit - Posion PKI</title></head><body><h2>Why This Works</h2><p>The Meshtastic firmware and application will automatically update a contact to use the latest public key seen in a NodeInfo packet sent by a user. Unique users are determined by the app based on the hardware MAC address of the node, which are sent in (or along side) NodeInfo packets along with a bunch of other information about the node, such as it's long and short name, public key, geographic position, and some other data which can be observed in the protobufs.</p><p>Meshtastic NodeInfo packets are not cryptographically signed with the node's public key, and neither are messages sent to any of the symmetrically encrypted group chats. There is currently no way to prove the authenticity of a Meshtastic message, and that likely includes DMs as well.</p><p>As a result of these design decisions, as well as poorly designed UX in the phone app, the NodeInfo of any node can have its public key field simply modified to an attacker controlled public key, and rebroadcast out to the mesh to poison the contact on any nearby Meshtastic device which is using the same modem preset and channel settings.</p><p>Users who had the poisoned node's old legitimate public key in their contacts from before the poisoning attack will get an alert that the contact's public key has changed and to verify it with the owner of the node, but only after clicking on a poisoned contact in the UI. A red broken "unsecure" lock is shown to users who have seen a node's intial public key change.</p><p>Users who are hearing that NodeInfo for the first time will add it as a new contact, and put a green secure lock icon on the contact, because the Meshtastic code will trust the first public key it sees broadcast by a MAC address. Subsequent valid (legitimate), non-poisoned keys sent in NodeInfos by the actual real user of the node will cause users who FIRST heard poisoned keys for another node to experience condition described above, where the Meshtastic UI will warn about potential key compromise and display a red broken lock to the user.</p><p>In addition to public key poisoning attack, any arbitrary field of the NodeInfo packet can be changed <b>while leaving the legitimate public key in tact</b>, and the forged NodeInfo can be sent out, which will cause any nearby node on the same mesh to update the field in their own contact database. This works because NodeInfo packets are not cryptographically signed in any way.</p><p></p><h2>Unintended Side Effects</h2><p>The rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than we initially anticipated and some of these attack vectors were thought up while exploit development was already underway. In addition, there was some entirely unexpected and surprising behavior observed from the phone application which was not closely audited during the course of this research.</p><p>The most notable unintended side effect observed during our research is that poisoned nodes will sometimes set their own name in the phone app to the name specified by the attacker while poisoning. Reports seem to indicate that restarting the node or app will cause the node's displayed name to revert to the name set by the owner. As far as we're able to tell, this is a display bug, but it is an indicator that untrusted input may be allowed into places it should never make it in other parts of the codebase as well.</p><p></p><h2>Specific Recommendations</h2><h3>To Meshtastic users</h3><p>Meshtastic in its current form should not be used as a trusted communication medium between a large untrusted group of users. Participating in large public channels exposes you to the effects of these attacks.</p><p>Meshtastic in its current form is probably mostly okay as a fairly trustworthy communication medium for a small group of individuals who mutually trust one another not to spy on or tamper with communications to one another. When using Meshtastic between a smaller trusted group of individuals, be sure to use your own frequency, modem settings, and encryption keys that are different from the defaults. Bear in mind that the packet headers are unencrypted, so some of your private mesh's metadata is still snoopable.</p><p></p><h3>To Meshtastic developers</h3><p>The hardware MAC address isn't easy for users to change and is easily trackable across meshes. It is a fairly poor unique ID indicator for a user due to it's trackable and non-cryptographic nature. Given the types of large and public untrusted mesh environments Meshtastic seems to be marketing itself towards, it is the opinion of the authors of this tool that using a MAC address as a unique node ID is unwise.</p><p>An asymmetric key pair should already be unique in order to serve its purpose. The public key is inherantly public, and must be accessible in order for other parties to securely send data to each other. It would make sense for the public key to be used as the main indicator of a unique user. Including the node's hardware MAC address in non-encrypted fields of the packet, or in fields that are decryptable with a symmetric key which is shared by hundreds or thousands of people is a recipe for allowing said users to get tracked or stalked.</p><p>Meshtastic would be wise to implement a stronger Trust-on-First-Use model that makes users aware of the importance of cross-verifying their keys over a trusted channel. Keys should not automatically be "trusted" the first time they are <b>seen</b>, especially without any user interaction. We understand that this may have been a design choice to make the use of the protocol and application easier for new and less experienced users, but we argue that it is deceptive to use a secure looking green lock icon for contacts which have had no actual cryptographic verification of their identities performed on, either manually by the user, or even cryptographically through signatures.</p><p>Meshtastic SHOULD cryptographically sign all messages sent to the mesh, ESPECIALLY portions of messages that are not encrypted, or in fields that are decryptable with a common shared key. Cryptographic signatures are the best way to ensure packet integrity and authenticity.</p><p></p></body></html></article></section><footer class="footer" id="PeOAagUepe"><div class="wrapper"><div style="margin-bottom:.5rem">meshmarauder</div>Fork: <a href="https://github.com/datapartyjs/meshmarauder">https://github.com/datapartyjs/meshmarauder</a><br>Built by <a href="https://www.dataparty.xyz">dataparty</a> with 🖤</div></footer></div></div></div><div class="search-container" id="PkfLWpAbet" style="display:none"><div class="wrapper" id="iCxFxjkHbP"><button class="icon-button search-close-button" id="VjLlGakifb" aria-label="close search"><svg><use xlink:href="#close-icon"></use></svg></button><div class="search-box-c"><svg><use xlink:href="#search-icon"></use></svg> <input type="text" id="vpcKVYIppa" class="search-input" placeholder="Search..." autofocus></div><div class="search-result-c" id="fWwVHRuDuN"><span class="search-result-c-text">Type anything to view search result</span></div></div></div><div class="mobile-menu-icon-container"><button class="icon-button" id="mobile-menu" data-isopen="false" aria-label="menu"><svg><use xlink:href="#menu-icon"></use></svg></button></div><div id="mobile-sidebar" class="mobile-sidebar-container"><div class="mobile-sidebar-wrapper"><a href="/" class="sidebar-title sidebar-title-anchor">meshmarauder</a><div class="mobile-nav-links"><div class="navbar-item"><a id="github-mobile" href="https://github.com/datapartyjs/meshmarauder" target="">Github</a></div></div><div class="mobile-sidebar-items-c"><div class="sidebar-section-title with-arrow" data-isopen="false" id="sidebar-tutorials"><div>Tutorials</div><svg><use xlink:href="#down-icon"></use></svg></div><div class="sidebar-section-children-container"><div class="sidebar-section-children"><a href="tutorial-01 Background and Recommendations.html">01 Background and Recommendations</a></div><div class="sidebar-section-children"><a href="tutorial-02 Setup Hardware.html">02 Setup Hardware</a></div><div class="sidebar-section-children"><a href="tutorial-03 Record LoRa Traffic.html">03 Record LoRa Traffic</a></div><div class="sidebar-section-children"><a href="tutorial-04 Record MQTT Traffic.html">04 Record MQTT Traffic</a></div></div></div><div class="mobile-navbar-actions"><div class="navbar-right-item"><button class="icon-button search-button" aria-label="open-search"><svg><use xlink:href="#search-icon"></use></svg></button></div><div class="navbar-right-item"><button class="icon-button theme-toggle" aria-label="toggle-theme"><svg><use class="theme-svg-use" xlink:href="#light-theme-icon"></use></svg></button></div><div class="navbar-right-item"><button class="icon-button font-size" aria-label="change-font-size"><svg><use xlink:href="#font-size-icon"></use></svg></button></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/core.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/search.min.js" defer="defer"></script><script src="scripts/third-party/fuse.js" defer="defer"></script><script type="text/javascript">var tocbotInstance=tocbot.init({tocSelector:"#eed4d2a0bfd64539bb9df78095dec881",contentSelector:".main-content",headingSelector:"h1, h2, h3",hasInnerContainers:!0,scrollContainer:".main-content",headingsOffset:130,onClick:bringLinkToView})</script></body></html>
